<h1><span>ibm</span> and <span>sap</span> are the latest technology players to announce large-scale layoffs, as companies seek to adapt to post-pandemic market demands.</h1>
<div class="ibm">
   <p>
IBM and SAP are the latest companies in Silicon Valley to announce their plans to cut thousands of jobs, following similar moves made by Spotify and Alphabet earlier this week. 
IBM has revealed it will cut around 3,900 jobs, amounting to 1.5 per cent of its global workforce. The layoffs will cost the company about $300m (£242m) this quarter, a spokesperson confirmed.

        <p> German software giant SAP also said it planned to lay off 2.5 per cent of its global workforce of 112,000, amounting to around 2,800 jobs. The restructuring will cost SAP between €250m (£219m) and €300m (€263m).</p>

      <div class="education">
         <p> Similarly, in a live-streamed presentation to reporters, SAP CEO Christian Klein said that the restructuring was “targeted” and would allow the company to invest in the areas “where it really matters for SAP to be competitive in the future,” particularly its cloud business.</p>
         <p>Educational institutions have an important role to play in this, and they’re the key to attracting more female talent. We need to have an educational structure in place that offers young women exposure to all aspects of the sector.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="company">
     <p> The company said it would explore a sale of its Qualtrics subsidiary, which specialises in online market research software. The sale would further allow SAP to focus more on its core cloud business, the company said.</p>

        <p> With this news, the companies join hundreds of other technology players that have recently opted to reduce their workforce due to market concerns.

      <div class="attention">
         <p>A lot of the attention is focused on software engineering and data analysis, but engineering is more than just apps and coding. A broad range of hard and soft skills are required and anyone can find a niche for themselves. Problem-solving is a daily occurrence, and if you’re logical or good at multitasking, you’ll thrive as a traditional engineer. If you’re creative, then perhaps design engineering is for you. If you’re a strong communicator and enjoy presenting, you might be interested in sales engineering. There’s a whole range of paths, and women should not be afraid to explore the full breadth of careers. There’s a role that fits every skill set in engineering, and as an industry we need to get better at advertising that.</p>
         <div class="list">
         <ul>
            <li>Universities could offer students the opportunity to visit</li>
            <li>rewarding industries you can work in - especially if you are</li>
            <li>I’d advise any woman considering a career</li>
            <li>This is how I found my way into the industry. </li>
            <li>I would be developing products</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
         <p>Not all women have had the same experience. Many are left wondering how they fit within the industry, or simply don’t engage with engineering at all despite the opportunities that are out there. It’s particularly true for the renewable energy sector. If we’re going to attract more women to the industry, then we need to change its perception.</p>
         <p>Engineering has a reputation that desperately needs to change. Traditionally viewed as a very technical industry with a high barrier to entry, it’s perceived as difficult to break into, and it’s clear that there’s a lack of knowledge of what engineering is truly about.</p>
